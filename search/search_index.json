This project evolved from the PWM example in the RPi-Pico repository. Overview \u00b6 What: A set of tiny classes that build generator factories (sequencers, repeaters, choosers, take-while helpers) that produce generators when called and a collection of float-valued generator factories such as sine, sawtooth, square, constant. Why: Make it easy to compose and reuse generator behavior across applications, with a MicroPython-friendly option by stripping type hints. By designing the Tester class, it is possible to write testers that communicate with other testers using a shared object. This could be used to program oscillations between the behaviors of collections of PWM-controlled LEDs. Key Features \u00b6 Generator Factories : Compose reusable generator patterns Wave Generators : Built-in sine, square, and sawtooth wave generators Flexible Control : Sequencing, repeating, random selection, and conditional testing MicroPython Compatible : Strip type hints for constrained environments Well Documented : Comprehensive docstrings and examples Quick Start \u00b6 from generator_builder import Constant , RepeaterFor , TakeWhile , CountTester from float_generator import sine_wave_factory # Create a sine wave that cycles 3 times sine = sine_wave_factory ( 16 , runs = 3 ) # Generate values for value in sine (): print ( round ( value , 2 )) Repository Structure \u00b6 File Purpose generator_builder.py Core generator-builder classes and examples float_generator.py Float-producing generator factories generator_builder_mp.py MicroPython-compatible version float_generator_mp.py MicroPython-compatible float generators strip_type_hints.py Utility to remove type hints pwm_leds/ PWM LED control examples License \u00b6 MIT License \u2014 see LICENSE for details.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#generator-builder","text":"A small collection of generator-builder utilities and helpers for creating reusable Python generator components (for example, to drive PWM LEDs).

Basic Concepts \u00b6 Generator Factories \u00b6 A GeneratorFactory is a callable object that creates fresh generators: from generator_builder import ConstantFor # Create a factory factory = ConstantFor ( 42 , 2 ) # Each call produces a fresh generator gen1 = factory () gen2 = factory () # They are independent instances print ( list ( gen1 )) # [42, 42] print ( list ( gen2 )) # [42, 42] Composing Generators \u00b6 Combine multiple factories to create complex behaviors: from generator_builder import ConstantFor , RepeaterFor , Sequencer # Create individual factories gen1 = ConstantFor ( 1 , 3 ) gen2 = ConstantFor ( 2 , 2 ) # Combine them seq = Sequencer ([ gen1 , gen2 ]) # Run print ( list ( seq ())) # [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] Wave forms \u00b6 Use built-in waveform generators to produce values from the waveform: from float_generator import sine_wave_factory # Create a sine wave with 16 steps per cycle sine = sine_wave_factory ( 16 ) # Generate values in [0, 1] for value in sine (): print ( f \"Value: { value : .2f } \" ) Next Steps \u00b6 Read the Core Concepts guide for detailed explanations Explore Usage Examples for practical patterns Check the API Reference for complete documentation","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"guide/getting_started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"guide/getting_started/#installation","text":"Generator Builder is a pure Python module.
